# ICARUS — Laboratory

This repository contains laboratory-level prototypes derived from the ICARUS
closed-cycle homeostatic architecture.

The code included here is experimental and intended exclusively for technical
analysis of internal dynamics, stability, and control mechanisms.

## Scope
- Laboratory prototypes only
- No claims of consciousness, intelligence, or agency
- No external tasks or datasets
- No production or deployment intent

The purpose of this repository is to explore and evaluate structural variants
of the ICARUS architecture at the level of dynamical systems and control theory.

## Contents
- PyTorch laboratory prototypes derived from ICARUS v0.3
- Experimental variants corresponding to laboratory hypotheses v0.4C
- Reference implementations related to SOR (Second-Order Regulation)

## Relationship to Prior Work
The work in this repository is conceptually and structurally derived from the
ICARUS architecture as disclosed in the following Zenodo records:

- ICARUS — Closed-Cycle Homeostatic Architecture (Prior Art & Prototypes)  
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17980099

- ICARUS — Laboratory Hypotheses v0.4C  
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18000091

- ICARUS — Second-Order Regulation (SOR): Laboratory Hypothesis vSOR-a  
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18030638

- ICARUS — Third-Order Regulation (TOR): Laboratory Hypothesis on Structural Limits  
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18035456

These laboratory implementations do not modify, redefine, or supersede the
frozen ICARUS specification or prior art.

## Status
- Laboratory
- Non-final
- Experimental
- Subject to independent evaluation

## Collaboration
ICARUS is open to **technical collaboration** focused on:
- implementation
- simulation
- stability and attractor analysis
- evaluation of laboratory hypotheses

The architecture and hypotheses are closed and published with DOI.
Collaboration is limited to implementation and technical analysis.

**Note:** Core conceptual documentation of ICARUS is written in Spanish;
fluent comprehension is required for meaningful technical collaboration.
