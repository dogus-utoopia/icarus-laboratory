# ICARUS — Laboratory

This repository contains laboratory-level prototypes derived from the
ICARUS closed-cycle homeostatic architecture.

The code included here is experimental and intended exclusively for technical
analysis of internal dynamics, stability, and control mechanisms.

## Scope

- Laboratory prototypes only
- No claims of consciousness, intelligence, or agency
- No external tasks or datasets
- No production or deployment intent

The purpose of this repository is to explore and evaluate structural variants
of the ICARUS architecture at the level of dynamical systems and control theory.

## Contents

- PyTorch laboratory prototypes derived from ICARUS v0.3
- Experimental variants corresponding to laboratory hypotheses v0.4C
  (emergent, imposed, and absent proportional modulation)

## Relationship to Prior Work

The work in this repository is conceptually and structurally derived from the
ICARUS architecture as disclosed in the following Zenodo records:

- ICARUS — Closed-Cycle Homeostatic Architecture (Prior Art & Prototypes)  
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17980099

- ICARUS — Laboratory Hypotheses v0.4C  
  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18000091

These laboratory implementations do not modify, redefine, or supersede the
frozen ICARUS specification or prior art.

## Status

- Laboratory
- Non-final
- Experimental
- Subject to independent evaluation
