ICARUS — Third-Order Regulation (TOR)
Laboratory Hypothesis on Structural Limits of Regulation

This directory documents the Third-Order Regulation (TOR) hypothesis
within the ICARUS closed-cycle homeostatic architecture.

TOR does not define an implementable mechanism.
It defines the structural boundary beyond which ICARUS ceases to be a
closed-cycle, non-representational architecture.

No source code is included or intended.

Interpretation:

First-order regulation concerns modulation of internal state.
Second-order regulation concerns stabilization of the regulatory parameter.
Third-order regulation concerns the regulation of the rule of regulation.

At this level, any operationalization necessarily introduces
representational structure or external reference.

Such systems are no longer ICARUS.
